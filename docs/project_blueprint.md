ðŸš€ NotANerd Project Blueprint (Detailed)
This document outlines the entire development plan, from initial setup to a complete end-to-end user flow.

Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration Control
Milestone 1: Create and Structure the Project Repository
Task 1.1: Create a GitHub Repository

Sub-task 1.1.1: Create a new private repository on GitHub named NotANerd-App.

Sub-task 1.1.2: Initialize the repository with a README.md file and a license of your choice (e.g., MIT License).

Definition of Done: A new, private GitHub repository exists with a README and license.

Task 1.2: Set Up the Repository Structure

Sub-task 1.2.1: Create the following directory structure:

/backend

/frontend

/docs

/.github/workflows

Definition of Done: The project repository has the defined folder structure.

Task 1.3: Implement Configuration Control

Sub-task 1.3.1: Create a .gitignore file in the root directory to ignore common development files (e.g., __pycache__, .env, node_modules, .DS_Store).

Sub-task 1.3.2: Create a .gitignore file inside the /backend folder to ignore Python-specific files (e.g., venv/).

Sub-task 1.3.3: Create a .gitignore file inside the /frontend folder to ignore Flutter/Dart-specific files.

Definition of Done: .gitignore files are in place to prevent sensitive or unnecessary files from being committed.

Task 1.4: Set up GitHub Issue Tracking Automation

Sub-task 1.4.1: Create shell scripts and commands to automatically set up the milestone and issue framework as defined in this plan.

Sub-task 1.4.2: Create a shell script to programmatically obtain and display the progress status of milestones and issues from the GitHub repository.

Definition of Done: Scripts for setting up and monitoring project management are created and functional.

Phase 2: CI/CD and Automated Testing Workflow
Milestone 2: Establish a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Task 2.1: Implement Backend Unit Testing

Sub-task 2.1.1: Create a tests/ directory inside the /backend folder.

Sub-task 2.1.2: Write a simple pytest test file (test_api.py) to test a basic function from your Python backend.

Definition of Done: A simple unit test file exists for your backend code.

Task 2.2: Create a Backend CI Workflow

Sub-task 2.2.1: Create a new file /.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml.

Sub-task 2.2.2: Configure the workflow to install Python dependencies, run pytest, and report the results on every push.

Definition of Done: The backend CI workflow is set up and successfully runs pytest on every code push.

Task 2.3: Create a Frontend CI Workflow

Sub-task 2.3.1: Create a new file /.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml.

Sub-task 2.3.2: Configure the workflow to check Dart formatting, lint the code, and run Flutter tests on every push.

Definition of Done: The frontend CI workflow is set up and successfully runs Flutter checks and tests.

Phase 3: Development, Implementation & Milestones
Milestone 3: Backend API Refinement and Deployment
Task 3.1: Add Firebase Auth Verification to Backend

Sub-task 3.1.1: Update requirements.txt to include firebase-admin.

Sub-task 3.1.2: Create a Python decorator function to verify the Firebase ID token in the request header.

Sub-task 3.1.3: Apply the new decorator to all protected API endpoints in your blueprint files (e.g., @user_bp.route('/data')).

Definition of Done: All backend API endpoints are now secured, requiring a valid Firebase ID token to be accessed.

Task 3.2: Manually Deploy the Backend to Google Cloud Functions

Sub-task 3.2.1: Create a Google Cloud Project.

Sub-task 3.2.2: Install the gcloud CLI and authenticate.

Sub-task 3.2.3: Download the Firebase service account key.

Sub-task 3.2.4: Update auth.py with the service account key path.

Sub-task 3.2.5: Deploy the Cloud Function to Google Cloud.

Sub-task 3.2.6: Test the public URL to ensure the function is accessible.

Definition of Done: The Python backend is live and accessible on a public Google Cloud Function URL.

Task 3.3: Set Up Automated Backend Deployment

Sub-task 3.3.1: Create a new file /.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml.

Sub-task 3.3.2: Configure the workflow to trigger on a merge to the main branch.

Sub-task 3.3.3: Use GitHub Secrets to securely store your Google Cloud credentials.

Sub-task 3.3.4: The workflow should build and deploy the Python backend to Google Cloud Functions.

Definition of Done: A successful merge to main automatically deploys the backend.

Milestone 4: Minimal Viable Flutter Front-End
Task 4.1: Set up the Flutter Project

Sub-task 4.1.1: Use the Flutter CLI to create a new project in the /frontend directory.

Sub-task 4.1.2: Open the project in your Codespaces IDE and run it in a web browser to confirm it works.

Definition of Done: A new, runnable Flutter project is set up.

Task 4.2: Integrate Firebase SDK

Sub-task 4.2.1: Add the firebase_core, firebase_auth, and cloud_firestore dependencies to your pubspec.yaml file.

Sub-task 4.2.2: Configure Firebase for your Flutter web, iOS, and Android projects.

Definition of Done: Firebase is successfully integrated and initialized in the Flutter app.

Phase 4: Documentation Management
Milestone 5: Maintain Project Documentation
Task 5.1: Create Project Documentation

Sub-task 5.1.1: Save this detailed project blueprint as docs/project_blueprint.md.

Sub-task 5.1.2: Use an AI-powered tool to generate initial API documentation from your Python code and save it as docs/api_documentation.md.

Definition of Done: A docs directory with the project plan and initial API documentation exists.
